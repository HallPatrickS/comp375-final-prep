Quiz 8 Learning Objectives:
 
Given a network, use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the routing and forwarding tables for every router in the network.
Given a network, use the Distance-Vector algorithm to compute the routing and forwarding tables for every router in the network.
Given a network, determine whether a link going down would cause a routing loop when using Distance-Vector.
Compare and contrast Link-State and Distance-Vector routing algorithms.
Explain how route poisoning can help eliminate routing loops.
Compare and contrast hot potato and cold potato routing.
Given a network with autonomous systems (ASes), determine the BGP route from a given AS to a destination prefix.
